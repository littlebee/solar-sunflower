  "body": "### The Solar Sunflower Project - Electric Sky Edition\r\n\r\nThe Solar Sunflower we are building for [Electric Sky](http://electricskyartcamp.com/) is a 500 watt solar generator.  It stands 12' tall with five flower petals on top.  \r\n\r\nEach of the five petals have \r\n- 1 x 100 Watt Residential Solar Panel\r\n- 50 Pixel LEDs \r\n- 1 x 400 pound force linear actuator\r\n- 1 x Arduino Uno with...\r\n- 10A DC Motor Sheild \r\n- 2 ACS712 current sensors for measuring drain and supply current\r\n\r\nThe Arduinos live in a common utility box (not pictured) at the base of the towers.  The five Arduino Unos communicate will communicate (slave) with a Raspberry PI (master) over I2C.  The Raspberry has a clock and a programmed cycle.  \r\n\r\nIn the morning (~8am) the Raspberry will instruct the petals to run a calibration sequence and analyze the results.  It will then instruct the petals to go into autonomous seek mode in which they will independently seek to the source of the most power being produced.    \r\n\r\nAt dusk the Rasberry will instruct all petals to fully extend (close) and enter a rest period.\r\n\r\nAt dark (~10) the flower will power up in display mode; open petals and run sequenced lighting through the 50 pixel LEDs on each petal.\r\n\r\nAt midnight the flower will again close and go into rest.\r\n\r\nCables run through the center of the tower.\r\n\r\n",
